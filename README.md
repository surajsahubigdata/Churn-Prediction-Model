# Churn-Prediction-Model

Problem Statement: Financial institutions, such as banks and insurance companies, face the constant challenge of customer churn, where customers stop using their services. Predicting customer churn allows these institutions to proactively engage at-risk customers with retention strategies. The goal is to build a model that can predict whether a customer is likely to leave the financial institution within a specific time frame, based on historical data.
